Most generally, a machine learning algorithm can be though of as a black box. It takes inputs and gives outputs. 
The purpose of this course is to show you how to create this ‘black box’ and tailor it to your needs.
For example, we may create a model that predicts the weather tomorrow, based on meteorological data about the past 
few days. 
The “black box” in fact is a mathematical model. The machine learning algorithm will follow a kind of trial-and-error 
method to determine the model that estimates the outputs, given inputs. 
Once we have a model, we must train it. Training is the process through which, the model learns how to make sense of 
input data.
